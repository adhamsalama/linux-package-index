# Linux Package Index

This is a project that aims to provide information about packages to install on Linux.

This is mainly to help ease the search for 3rd party packages that don't exist in apt or dnf, Like Spotify, Slack, etc...

The project aims to provide URLs for the package files, and possibly in the future, download them directly, and maybe even convert DEB packages to RPM for packages that don't have an RPM package.

There is no way to automate this, I will mainly add the information for packages that I personally use.

Any help is most welcome.

This is also a hobby project to try some modern Python tools and paradigms, like using Poetry, FastAPI, type hinting & checking (mypy), SQLModel, and testing (pytest).
